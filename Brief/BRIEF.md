# Algorithms Assignment Brief

## Project Brief
The Higher Diploma in Computing and the Master's Qualifier are postgraduate programmes in the School of Computer Science.
Both are aimed at graduates of other disciplines to enable them to switch over to a career in Computer Science.
These programmes are delibered conjointly, at the same time.

There are four different types of module which students can attend:-
1. DT265A - part-time Higher Diploma
2. DT265C - part-time Master's Qualifier
3. DT265B - full-time Master's Qualifier
4. DT8900 - full-time International Master's Qualifier

Admission numbers are as follows:
DT265A - 13 Students
DT265C - 9 Students
DT265B - 14 Students
DT8900 - 6 Students

This data must be maintained in a single table or list for each module.
The course has just been advertised and some students may join while others leave their courses.

## To be Delivered
1. Design a suitable data type for manipulating and storing the data having regard to the underlying changeability and the need for instant reporting. Explain your design.
2. In a FLOW-CHART, write an algorithm that combines the four lists into one main list, sorted by surname.
    a. You should attempt to modify a sorting algorithm you're familiar with to do this.
    b. What is its Big O? Illustrate in detail why.
3. Using PSEUDO-CODE,
    a. Write an algorithm to search the main list for all full-time students.
    b. What is the order of growth of this algorithm? Explain your answer with reference to Big O.
4. Using PSEUDO-CODE, write an algorithm to search the main list for a specific student by surname. The running time of your algorithm should be O(log n). Explain how your algorithm meets this requirement.
5. Implement the algorithms derived in 1, 2, 3, and 4 in C. Show how you test your software by creating test data which matches that outlined in the Requirements specification (i.e. Lists of student names, programmes and programme type.)
